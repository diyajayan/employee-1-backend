# employee-1-backend
This project focuses on developing the backend of an Employee Management Application. The frontend of the app is already provided as a build/dist folder, which must not be modified. The goal is to create a Node.js and Express-based backend that connects to a MongoDB Atlas database to perform CRUD operations on employee data.
